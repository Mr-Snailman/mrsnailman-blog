Hello, and welcome to Thoughtful Brew! Thank you again for taking the time to check us out. We are a blog dedicated to the togetherness and interest around Beer, Brewing and the community surrounding the hobby and profession. We envision this platform becomes an outlet for our internal musings on beer and beer culture, educating the general public on the growing passtime, as well as providing a great place to discuss topics and trends within the industry.

My name is Dustin Saunders, and I am a Software Developer during the day, enjoying solving problems and collaborating with customers and partners to provide solutions. Although, in my spare time, I enjoy the process of homebrewing as well as learning how to become better and improve through continual development of my skills and process. There is a problem solving aspect to most parts of life, and I find that brewing is no different.

In addition to my day to day and hobbies, I volunteer my time to a non-profit, Exerceo. We harness this concept and bring learning into every day life with the candidates that we mentor and collaborate with. Extending our time to others in hopes to make a brighter tomorrow helps drive me further forward to bring these skills and processes into everyday life as well, in addition to my hobbies. I believe that through brewing and beer, this idea extends even further; simply put:

### Beer brings people together.

I stand by this and is the main reason why I am starting this endeavor. My goal is to continue this mantra through quality content and education of the brewing industry, the brewing process and the people that surround it. I hope to continue the conversation as it has been for years and years and invite others to participate along the way. 

Feel free to reach out via our [Contact Us](/contact) Page with any questions, concerns or comments. Thanks again for your continued support!
